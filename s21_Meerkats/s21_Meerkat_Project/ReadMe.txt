To follow along you can CTRL-F to "//" for a guided tour
// Our tour starts on the first menu as soon as you run the Puppies_Run_Me.java:

						(Checkpoint D update!!)
FIRST...You must save the SaveData.txt file to your computer before running the program. 
		choose option 3 from main menu for the dynamic bids that are preset to open and some that are set to close immediately for sample 
SECOND...We implemented backlog data and history, to test backlog after closing hours you need to manually change the date and time on your computer

Here is the initial menu:

 Welcome to Puppy Heaven!
1. Search puppies: 
2. Sign in: 
3. Load sample data: (for testing/grading purposes: dynamic dates) 
4. Display active bids: 
5. Exit: 
Choice: 

Option 1: Working to search by name or price. Pre-loaded with several Puppies objects:
		Puppies pupA = new Puppies("Ginger", "poodle", "male", true, 2000.0, false, true);
		Puppies pupB = new Puppies("Pepper", "beagle", "male", true, 1000.0, false, true);
		Puppies pupC = new Puppies("Red", "German Shepherd", "female", true, 1500.0, false, true);
		Puppies pupD = new Puppies("Weston", "Alsation", "female", false, 200, true, true);
		
		The primary key for the puppies is the name (e.g. Jolly, Happy, etc.).
		
Option 2: Sign in is working, we have several profiles created for Customers as well as Admins:
		dwolff|CutePups|Diane|Wolff|true
		assteroids|123|Leah|Clemens|true
		willzy|apple|Will|McCoy|true
		jdoe|apple|31 Old Warren Rd.|schmoe@gmail.com
		dave|apple|7457 Grapetree Lane|dave@superdave.com
		
		In the 1st case is an admin: user name: dwolff, password: CutePups, First Name: Diane, Last name: Wolff, boolean for use later. 

		The 2nd case is a customer: user name: jdoe, password: apple, address, email for PayPal
		
Option 3: Works, program loads sample data from SavedData.txt file and displays auctions that have ended. However, this option
			would not be in the end user program and is used for data (times) that are dynamic (e.g. end 5 minutes from program 
			start).

Option 4: Works, shows any active auctions.

Option 5: Works, ends program.
